    "text": "Sadly, I was born in Overland Park, Kansas, but I was raised in Lee’s Summit, Missouri (just outside of Kansas City). There I become an avid sports fan. Well, I strongly dislike soccer, but I love baseball, softball, football, hockey, track, and all that stuff. I came to the University of Nebraska to chase my Olympic dream of throwing the javelin in a team USA uniform. Nebraska converted me to someone that says “ope” and “you guys.” Currently, I am in a Sport Media class all about writing code and creating fun graphs. This class is a love/hate relationship in its truest form. Sometimes I cry while doing homework assignments, but moments later I created something pretty cool. So here it is, my blog."

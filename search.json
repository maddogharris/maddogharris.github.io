    "text": "In 2022, the Phillies were 14 games back of first place in their division with two 100+ win teams ahead of them: the Braves and the Mets. After the first 50 games of the season, the divisional rankings did not change much, and if the Phillies were going to make the post season, they would have to based on their winning percentage. The extended playoffs allowed three wildcard teams to clinch playoff births, and this allowed the 2022 Phillies to clinch the last spot during the 160th game of the year against the Houston Astros on October 3.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nphigames <- read_csv(\"phigames.csv\")\nmetgames <- read_csv(\"metgames.csv\")\natlgames <- read_csv(\"atlgames.csv\")\nwasgames <- read_csv(\"wasgames.csv\")\nmiagames <- read_csv(\"miagames.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data= phigames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#E81828\") +\n  geom_line(data= metgames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#FF5910\") +\n  geom_line(data= atlgames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#EAAA00\")+\n  geom_line(data= miagames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#009CA6\")+\n  geom_line(data= wasgames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#14225A\") +\n  \n   labs(\n    x=\"Game\", \n    y=\"National League East Rank\", \n    title=\"The Phillies were stuck in third place\", \n    subtitle=\"The Braves (gold) and the Mets(orange) fought for first place in the division until the end.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | Madelyn Harris\"\n    ) +\n\ntheme_minimal() + \n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) \n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the Phillies gut it out to claim their playoff birth? It definitely was not because of their defense. The Phillies defense was ranked one of the most inefficient in the league with only four last place teams (Royals, Red Sox, Pirates, Rockies) and the Giants ranking lower than Philadelphia. The Phillies were among the top in the league in OPS. OPS takes the team’s on base percentage and their slugging percentage which takes into consideration how many bases the team is getting every time they get on base.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nmlbf <- read_csv(\"fielding22.csv\")\nmlbb <- read_csv(\"season22.csv\")\n\nphif <- mlbf %>% \n  filter(Tm== \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\nphib <- mlbb %>% \n  filter(Tm== \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\ncombined <- mlbf %>% inner_join(mlbb)\ncombinedphi <-  phif %>% inner_join(phib)\n\ncombinedpo <- combined %>% \n  filter(Tm == \"Tampa Bay Rays\" |Tm== \"Cleveland Guardians\"|Tm==  \"Seattle Mariners\"|Tm==  \"Toronto Blue Jays\"|Tm==  \"New York Yankees\"|Tm== \"Houston Astros\"|Tm== \"Philadelphia Phillies\"|Tm== \"St. Louis Cardinals\"|Tm== \"Atlanta Braves\"|Tm== \"San Diego Padres\"|Tm== \"New York Mets\"|Tm== \"Los Angeles Dodgers\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(\n    data= combined,\n    aes(\n    x= DefEff,\n    y= OPS),\n  color= \"gray\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data= combinedphi,\n    aes(\n    x= DefEff,\n    y= OPS),\n  color= \"#E81828\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = .697, color= \"#7BAFD4\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = .706, color = \"#7BAFD4\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data= combinedpo, \n    aes(x= DefEff, y=OPS, label= Tm))+ \ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Defensive Efficiency\", \n    y=\"On Base Percentage plus Slugging\", \n    title=\"The Phillies are the worst defense in the playoffs\", \n    subtitle=\"The Phillies can get on base, but have a hard time getting their pitcher off the mound.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | Madelyn Harris\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the 2022 season, only the American League had designated hitters, and pitchers would hit in the National League. In the first month of the season, Harper injured his right elbow while playing right field. In previous years, this injury would have put Harper out for the season and weaken the Phillies offense. Instead, Harper was able to stay in the line up as the designated hitter for most of the season. Harper still missed a third of the season with various injuries, but remained one of the Phillies most influential players.\n\n\nCode\nallbatting <- read_csv(\"allbatting.csv\") %>% mutate(Name = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Name)) %>% mutate(Name = gsub(\"\\\\#\", \"\", Name))\nvalue<- read_csv(\"value.csv\") %>% mutate(Name = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Name)) %>% mutate(Name = gsub(\"\\\\#\", \"\", Name))\n\nactivebatting <- allbatting %>% \n  filter(PA > 100)\ncombined <- value %>% inner_join(activebatting, by = c(\"Name\", \"Age\", \"Tm\", \"G\", \"PA\"))\nphillies <- combined %>% \n  filter(Tm == \"PHI\")\nbryce <- combined %>% \n  filter(Name == \"Bryce Harper\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(\n    data=combined, \n    aes(x=RBI, y=BA, size= WAR), \n    color= \"grey\",\n    alpha= .3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data= phillies,\n    aes(x=RBI, y= BA, size =WAR),\n    color= \"#E81828\",\n    alpha= .3 )+\n  geom_point(\n    data= bryce,\n    aes(x=RBI, y= BA, size= WAR),\n    color= \"#002D72\",\n    alpha= .3)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 38.77528,color = \"#7BAFD4\")  +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.2376966, color= \"#7BAFD4\")  +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=phillies, \n    aes(x= RBI, y=BA, label=Name))+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Runs Batted In\", \n    y=\"Batting Average\", \n    title=\"The Phillies needed Bryce Harper to get to the Playoffs\", \n    subtitle=\"Bryce Harper was one of the Phillies most influential players in making it to the post season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | Madelyn Harris\"\n    )+\ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Phillies entered post season play, Harper’s offensive production grew. The Phillies went 8-1 prior to the World Series. In the National League Championship Game 5, Harper hit a two-run home run against the Padres in the eighth inning that would send Philadelphia to their first World Series since 2009. Bryce Harper currently leads the team in seven offensive stats for the post season. The Phillies would not be in the World Series without the universal DH.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\n\npostphillies <- read_csv(\"postphillies.csv\")\n\npost<- \n  postphillies %>% \n  select(NAME, H, HR, RBI, AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS) %>% \n  arrange(desc(AVG))\n\npost %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Bryce Harper led the Phillies to the World Series\",\n    subtitle = \"Not only did Harper hit the homerun to get the Phillies to the World Series, but he leads the team in seven offensive stats.\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Madelyn Harris  |  **Source:** ESPN\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")%>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#002D72\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = NAME ==\"Bryce Harper\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Bryce Harper led the Phillies to the World Series\n    \n    \n      Not only did Harper hit the homerun to get the Phillies to the World Series, but he leads the team in seven offensive stats.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      NAME\n      H\n      HR\n      RBI\n      AVG\n      OBP\n      SLG\n      OPS\n    \n  \n  \n    Bryce Harper\n21\n6\n13\n0.368\n0.410\n0.789\n1.199\n    Edmundo Sosa\n2\n0\n2\n0.333\n0.375\n0.500\n0.875\n    J.T.

Regular season records mean nothing in October. October baseball is where grit and toughness shines through. The Phillies offense displays just that. Without the addition of the universal DH, the Phillies would have been lacking the offensive powerhouse of Bryce Harper. Harper has postseason experience with the Washington Nationals earlier in his career, and has been able to lead the younger players of the Phillies through the playoffs."

    "text": "Sadly, I was born in Overland Park, Kansas, but I was raised in Lee’s Summit, Missouri (just outside of Kansas City). There I become an avid sports fan. Well, I strongly dislike soccer, but I love baseball, softball, football, hockey, track, and all that stuff. I came to the University of Nebraska to chase my Olympic dream of throwing the javelin in a team USA uniform. Nebraska converted me to someone that says “ope” and “you guys.” Currently, I am in a Sport Media class all about writing code and creating fun graphs. This class is a love/hate relationship in its truest form. Sometimes I cry while doing homework assignments, but moments later I created something pretty cool. So here it is, my blog."

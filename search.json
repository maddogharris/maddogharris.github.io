    "text": "In 2022, the Phillies were 14 games back of first place in their division with two 100+ win teams ahead of them: the Braves and the Mets. After the first 50 games of the season, the divisional rankings did not change much, and if the Phillies were going to make the post season, they would have to based on their winning percentage. The extended playoffs allowed three wildcard teams to clinch playoff births, and this allowed the 2022 Phillies to clinch the last spot during the 160th game of the year against the Houston Astros on October 3.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nphigames <- read_csv(\"phigames.csv\")\nmetgames <- read_csv(\"metgames.csv\")\natlgames <- read_csv(\"atlgames.csv\")\nwasgames <- read_csv(\"wasgames.csv\")\nmiagames <- read_csv(\"miagames.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data= phigames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#E81828\") +\n  geom_line(data= metgames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#FF5910\") +\n  geom_line(data= atlgames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#EAAA00\")+\n  geom_line(data= miagames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#009CA6\")+\n  geom_line(data= wasgames, aes(x=`Gm#`, y= Rank), color= \"#14225A\") +\n  \n   labs(\n    x=\"Game\", \n    y=\"National League East Rank\", \n    title=\"The Phillies were stuck in third place\", \n    subtitle=\"The Braves (gold) and the Mets(orange) fought for first place in the division until the end.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | Madelyn Harris\"\n    ) +\n\ntheme_minimal() + \n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) \n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the Phillies gut it out to claim their playoff birth? It definitely was not because of their defense. The Phillies defense was ranked one of the most inefficient in the league with only four last place teams (Royals, Red Sox, Pirates, Rockies) and the Giants ranking lower than Philadelphia. The Phillies were among the top in the league in OPS. OPS takes the team’s on base percentage and their slugging percentage which takes into consideration how many bases the team is getting every time they get on base.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nmlbf <- read_csv(\"fielding22.csv\")\nmlbb <- read_csv(\"season22.csv\")\n\nphif <- mlbf %>% \n  filter(Tm== \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\nphib <- mlbb %>% \n  filter(Tm== \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\ncombined <- mlbf %>% inner_join(mlbb)\ncombinedphi <-  phif %>% inner_join(phib)\n\ncombinedpo <- combined %>% \n  filter(Tm == \"Tampa Bay Rays\" |Tm== \"Cleveland Guardians\"|Tm==  \"Seattle Mariners\"|Tm==  \"Toronto Blue Jays\"|Tm==  \"New York Yankees\"|Tm== \"Houston Astros\"|Tm== \"Philadelphia Phillies\"|Tm== \"St. Louis Cardinals\"|Tm== \"Atlanta Braves\"|Tm== \"San Diego Padres\"|Tm== \"New York Mets\"|Tm== \"Los Angeles Dodgers\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(\n    data= combined,\n    aes(\n    x= DefEff,\n    y= OPS),\n  color= \"gray\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data= combinedphi,\n    aes(\n    x= DefEff,\n    y= OPS),\n  color= \"#E81828\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = .697, color= \"#7BAFD4\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = .706, color = \"#7BAFD4\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data= combinedpo, \n    aes(x= DefEff, y=OPS, label= Tm))+ \ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Defensive Efficiency\", \n    y=\"On Base Percentage plus Slugging\", \n    title=\"The Phillies are the worst defense in the playoffs\", \n    subtitle=\"The Phillies can get on base, but have a hard time getting their pitcher off the mound.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | Madelyn Harris\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the 2022 season, only the American League had designated hitters, and pitchers would hit in the National League.

Instead, Harper was able to stay in the line up as the designated hitter for most of the season.

The Phillies went 8-1 prior to the World Series. In the National League Championship Game 5, Harper hit a two-run home run against the Padres in the eighth inning that would send Philadelphia to their first World Series since 2009.

Regular season records mean nothing in October. October baseball is where grit and toughness shines through. The Phillies offense displays just that. Without the addition of the universal DH, the Phillies would have been lacking the offensive powerhouse of Bryce Harper. Harper has postseason experience with the Washington Nationals earlier in his career, and has been able to lead the younger players of the Phillies through the playoffs."

American League Rookie of the Year. The way their careers would turn out after this award would be polar opposites.\nGeovany Soto stands out with 86 RBIs in his Rookie of the Year campaign in 2008 with the Chicago Cubs. That year Soto would go on to be an All Star, but that would be the highlight of his career statistically. In 2008 he had 141 hits, but he would never get more than 100 hits in a season again. Geovany Soto is not a household name for a reason. After 2011, he would leave the Cubs and continue to jump from team to team. The sophomore slump was real for Soto.\nOn the opposite side of things, Dustin Pedrioa would rank lower in RBIs compared to other ROY winners, and slightly higher on Hits. Pedrioa would go on to be a lifelong Red Sox. He would go on to be a four-time All-Star and four-time golden glove second basemen. In 2008, the year after he won the ROY award, he would win American League MVP and lead the league in Runs, Hits, and Doubles. Pedroia would help the Red Sox win two World Series in 2007 and 2013 as well.\nIn 2012, Bryce Harper and Mike Trout would win the Rookie of the Year awards. Harper and Trout has continued to stay in the headlines on their respective teams in the last 11 seasons.\n\n\nCode\nharper <- read_csv(\"harper.csv\") \ntrout <- read_csv(\"trout.csv\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=harper, aes(x=Year, y=BA), color=\"navy\") +\n  geom_point(data=harper, aes(x=Year, y=BA), color=\"navy\")+\n  geom_line(data=trout, aes(x=Year, y=BA), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=trout, aes(x=Year, y=BA), color=\"red\")+\n   labs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Batting Average\", \n    title=\"Mike Trout is reliable as can be\", \n    subtitle=\"Bryce Harper has stayed above .240, but he has his ups and downs.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Maddie Harris\"\n    )  + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Trout is the face of baseball. Trout is a 10-time All Star, three-time American League MVP (four times finishing second in MVP race), and nine-time silver slugger. In this time, the Angels have sucked. The Halos made the post season once in Trout’s era in 2014, and they lost in the first round. Trout is undeniably one of the best athletes to have ever played the game.\nAt the same time, Bryce Harper has made a completely different name for himself in baseball. Harper was known as a hot head early in his career making him a player that fans loved to hate. Harper is a seven-time All Star, two-time National League MVP, and two-time silver slugger. Since Harper hasn’t played for such a painfully awful team like the Angels, made it to the post season four times with the Nationals and once with the Phillies. While the Nationals never made it past the National League Divisional Series, in 2022 the Phillies made it all the way to the World Series. Harper was a big part of this battle. The Phillies were not suppose to be in the World Series, as they clinched the last playoff spot in the National League. But Harper would go on to win the National League Championship Series MVP, as he hit six home runs, batted .347 and had 13 RBIs. Harper has a postseason career batting average of .273. Therefor, Harper has made more of an impact when it comes to team success.\nThis whole time we have been focusing on offensive stats, and we have failed to mention one of the most important positions on the field. The pitchers who has won Rookie of the Year between 2002 and 2012. The names that stand out the most are Justin Verlander and Craig Kimbrel.\nYou may know Craig Kimbrel as the relief pitcher that hangs his arm out all wonky before he pitches the ball. Kimbrel won the National League Rookie of the Year in 2011 as he led the league in saves and games finished. Kimbrel has played in eight post seasons, and he won the World Series in 2018 with the Boston Red Sox. The eight-time All Star has been a key part to many championship caliber teams.\nOn the other hand, Justin Verlander has been one of the most dominant starting pitchers in the last 17 seasons. Verlander is a three-time Cy Young winner, nine-time All Star, 2011 American League MVP, and 2006 American League Rookie of the Year. Verlander has also led the league in strikeouts in five different seasons. After not pitching at all in the 2021 season due to having Tommy John Surgery, Verlander won the CY Young and led the Astros to a World Series victory in 2022.\nHere I am comparing Verlander to other Cy Young winners of the past couple of years in the AL and NL. Many of the pitchers he is compared to has also won several Cy Young awards, and have been a part of many World Series Championship teams.\n\n\nCode\njv<- read_csv(\"verlander.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 19

Scherzer is the red line, Jacob DeGrom is orange, and Trevor Bauer is black. Scherzer is very comparable to Verlander as he is an older starting pitcher, and he has also gotten better with age. Max Scherzer is known as one of the most fierce competitors in the game and probably Verlander’s biggest compeitior when it comes to best pitcher of the last decade. DeGrom is highlighted because he has won two Cy Young awards in the past six years, so he has been dominate in his short career. Bauer is highlighed because he had a high ERA, then during the short 2020 season, he improved his ERA greatly.\nWinning Rookie of the Year may be more important for a position player than a pitcher. Position players seem to have better seasons in their youth, as pitchers seem to improve with age. Out of the the 2002-2012 ROY winners, Harper, Trout, Verlander, and Pedrioa have made the most out of their careers since receiving the award."

Well, I strongly dislike soccer, but I love baseball, softball, football, hockey, track, and all that stuff. I came to the University of Nebraska to chase my Olympic dream of throwing the javelin in a team USA uniform. Nebraska converted me to someone that says “ope” and “you guys.” Currently, I am in a Sport Media class all about writing code and creating fun graphs. This class is a love/hate relationship in its truest form. Sometimes I cry while doing homework assignments, but moments later I created something pretty cool. So here it is, my blog."
